## TexNet Earthquake Injection Correlation Tool 

### Introduction 
The purpose of the Earthquake Injection Correlation Tool is to quickly analyze the correlation between oil & gas fracking operations and the inducement of earthquakes. This tool plots the bottom-hole pressure experienced underground daily with the N closest oil & gas wells to a given earthquake, with the goal of understanding its influence on earthquake occurrence.

Traditionally in the seismology field, it is understood that oil & gas operations are inducing earthquakes, which can be seen with the high volume and frequency of earthquakes that occur in oil & gas fields daily. However, this correlation isn't fully understood yet, and the goal of this tool is to easily visualize the trends that are occurring in these fields to develop a better understanding of how humans induce earthquakes. 

### How to Use 

1. Pull the repository on your given environment
2. Export from [TexNet](https://injection.texnet.beg.utexas.edu/) the latest injection well data and put it in your desired data folder 
3. Download the TexNet Earthquake Catalog from [Bureau of Economic Geology, University of Texas at Austin](https://www.beg.utexas.edu/texnet-cisr/texnet/earthquake-catalog) and put it in your data folder
4. Provide a formation to calculate well type (shallow or deep)
